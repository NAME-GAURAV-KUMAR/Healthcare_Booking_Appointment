⚙️ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (which includes npm)

MongoDB (local installation or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Install backend dependencies:

npm install

Create a .env file:
Create a file named .env in the backend directory.

touch .env

Configure environment variables:
Add the following variables to your newly created .env file, replacing the placeholder values:

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=a_very_strong_and_random_secret_key
PORT=5000 # Or any port you prefer

MONGO_URI: Your MongoDB connection string (e.g., from MongoDB Atlas or your local instance).

JWT_SECRET: A long, random string used to sign your JWTs. You can generate one online or use a tool.

Start the backend server:

node server.js

The backend server should now be running, typically on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory (in a new terminal):

cd frontend

Install frontend dependencies:

npm install

Start the React development server:

npm start

The frontend application should now open in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.

💡 Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running:

Register a New Account: Navigate to the registration page (/register) to create a new user account.

Login: Use your newly created credentials to log in.

Explore Dashboard:

Patients: Can view available doctors, book appointments, and manage their existing appointments.

Doctors: (Requires manual setup or specific registration logic) Can view their scheduled appointments.

Health Tips: Access the health tips generator feature on the frontend.

Contact Popup: Utilize the contact popup for any inquiries or feedback.
